The analysis reveals significant improvements in throughput and response times. Methodology: We collected performance data using automated monitoring tools and conducted load testing under various scenarios. The metrics include CPU utilization, memory usage, network latency, and transaction throughput. Key Findings: 1. Average response time decreased by 23% compared to the previous quarter 2. System throughput increased by 31% during peak hours 3. Memory utilization remained stable at 67% average 4. Network latency improved by 15% after infrastructure upgrades Recommendations: Based on our analysis, we recommend continued monitoring and potential scaling of the database tier to handle increased load.",
